# CSS Foundations

##Basic Syntax
At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selector and a semi-colon list of declarations, with each of those declarations being made up of a property: value pair.

>Note: A `div` is one of the basic HTML elements. It is simply an empty container. In general, it is best to use other tags such as `<h1>` or `<p>` for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you will find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain `<div>s` for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements. 

## Selectors
Selectors simply refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they are what is actually being "selected" for each rule:

#### Universal Selector 
The universal selector will select elements of any type and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple` style applied to it.

```css
* {
  color: purple;
}
```
#### Type Selector 
A type selector will select all elements of a given element type and the syntax is just the name of the element. In the example below, all three `div` elements will be colored white while the `p` won't.
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>Hello, World!</div>
<div>Hello again!</div>
<p>Hi...</p>
<div>Okay, bye.</div>
```
```css
/* styles.css */

div {
  color: white;
}
```
#### Class Selector 
Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here is how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">
  Please agree to our terms of service.
</div>
```
```css
/* styles.css */

.alert-text {
  color: red;
}
```
Note the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be unique so you can use the same class on as many elements are you want. 

Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class = "alert-text severe-alert"`. Since whitespace is used to separate tags, you should never create class names with whitespace.
#### ID Selector 
ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
```
```css
/* styles.css */

#title {
  background-color: red;
}
```
Instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case sensitive value of the ID attribute. One major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. An ID cannot be repeated on a single page and the ID attribute should not contain any whitespace. 

#### Grouping Selector 
If we have two groups of elements that share some of the same style declarations, we can group the two selectors together as a comma separated list:

```css
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}
```
Grouping reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once. 
### Chaining Selectors:

Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. 

```html
<div>
	<div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
	<p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

Here with have two elements with the subsection class, but if we want to add a separate rule only for “subsection header” this can be achieved through chaining:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
```

What this piece of code above does is that it selects any element that has both the section and header classes. It can be also used to chain a class an ID, as shown below: 

 

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

Which can be chained as follows:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Descendant Combinator

Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them. There are four types of combinators in total but one of them is the descendant combinator. This is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. 

A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent and child) that matches the previous selectors. 

- so something like .ancestor.child would select an element with the class child if it has an ancestor with the class ancestor, no matter how deep it is.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
    </div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->

```

```css
/* styles.css */

.ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}
```

In the above example, the first two elements with the contents class (B and C) but D would not since it is not as it is not nested. 

There is no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule so .one.two.three.four would be valid. 

## Properties to Get Started With

### Color and Background-Color

The color property sets an elements color, while background color sets the background color of the element.

- Both of these properties can accept several kinds of color values such as HEX, RGB, and HSL values.
- You can also change the opacity through adding an alpha value

### Typography Basics and Text-Align

font-family can be a single value or comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories:

- a font family name like `"Times New Roman"`
- or a generic family name like `sans-serif`

If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will just use the next one in the list until it can.

`font-size` sets the size of the font and looks like font-size: 22px
`font-weight` affects the boldness of the font if the font supports it. 

`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have for this property like center, left, right, and etc.

### Image Height and Width

By default, an `<img>` elements height and width values are the same as the actual image file’s height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of auto for the height property and just adjust width. 

```css
img {
  height: auto;
  width: 500px;
}
```

It is best to include both of these properties for `<img>` elements even if you do not plan to adjust the values, as it causes images to load up faster and create a nicer user experience.

## The Cascade of CSS

Sometimes we may have rules that conflict with one another, and we end up with some unexpected results. As frustrating as this can be, it is important to know that CSS only does what we tell it to do. One exception to this is the default styles that are provided by a browser. These default styles vary from browser to browser, and they are why some elements create a large gap between themselves and other elements, or why buttons look the way they do.  

If you end up with some unexpected behaviour like this it is either because of these default styles, not understanding a property, or the cascade. 

The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. These are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this, three of which we will go over:

### Specificity 
A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. Inline styles have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of selector has it own specificity level that contributes to how specific a declaration is. Other selectors contribute to specificity, but we are focusing only on the ones mentioned in this lesson:
1. ID selectors
2. Class selectors 
3. Type selectors

Consider the following HTML and CSS code:
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list subsection"></div>
</div>
```

```css
/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
```

In the example above, both rules are using only class selectors but rule 2 is more specific as it is using more class selectors, so the `color:red` would take precedence. 

Now if we change it to:

```css
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
```
Despite rule 2 having more class selectors than ID selectors, rule 1 is more specific because ID beats class. In this case, the `color: blue` would take precedence.

Lastly, if we consider this code: 

```css
/* rule 1 */
.list #subsection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list #subsection {
  color: red;
}
```
In this example, both rules are using the ID and class selectors so neither rule is more specific than each other. But since rule 2 has more class selectors, rule 2 has a higher specificity. 
Additionally, while `color: red` would take precedence, `background-color: yellow` would still be applied since there is not conflicting argument. 

#### Inheritance
Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element are inherited by that element's descendants, even if we do not explicitly write a rule for those descendants.
> Typography based properties (`color`, `font-size`, `font-family`, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren’t.

For example: 
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

#parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}
```
Although the `parent` element has a higher specificity with an ID selector, the `child` element would have the `color: blue` style applied since it has a declaration directly applied to it as opposed to the `color: red` which is only inherited.


### Rule Order
If every factor has been taken into account, the tie-breaker would be **the rule that was last defined.**
```css
/* styles.css */

.alert {
  color: red;
}

.warning {
  color: yellow;
}
```

For an element that has both the `alert` and `warning` classes, the cascade would run through every other factor, including inheritance and specificity. Since the `.warning` rule was the last one defined it is the one that gets applied to the element.

## Adding CSS to HTML
If you want to add CSS to HTML files, there are three methods to do so:
###External CSS
This is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing the `<head>`
