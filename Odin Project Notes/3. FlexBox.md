# Flexbox

Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex based on some simple rules that you can define. 


### Flex Containers and Flex Items

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.

Confusingly, any element can both be a flex container and a flex item.

Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way we will be building up complex layouts. The following image was achieved using only flexbox to arrange, size, and place the various elements. Flexbox is a very powerful tool.

## The Flex Shorthand
The `flex` declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. 

> A shorthand property is a type of CSS property that lets you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously. 

In this case `flex` is actually a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

Very often when you see the flex shorthand defined with only one value. In that case that that value is applied to `flex-grow`. So when we put `flex: 1` on our divs, we were actually specifying a shorthand of `flex: 1 1 0`
