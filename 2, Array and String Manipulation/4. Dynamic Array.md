# Dynamic Array

A dynamic array is an array with a big improvement: automatic resizing.

One limitation of arrays is that they're fixed size, meaning you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time.

A dynamic array expands as you add more elements. So you don't need to determine the size ahead of time.

#### Strengths
+ Fast lookups 
+ variable size
+ cache-friendly
#### Weaknesses
+ slow worst-case appends
+ costly inserts and deletes

Function | Average Case | Worst Case 
--- | --- | ---
space | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$
lookup | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$
append | $O(1)$ | $O(n)$
insert | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$
delete | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$

###In C++:
Here is what a dynamic array looks like: 
```cpp
vector<int> gasPrices;
//adding an item to the end 
gasPrices.push_back(346);
gasPrices.push_back(360);
gasPrices.push_back(354);

```
