# MECHTRON 2MD3 | Assignment 2

## Question 1 `!need to change due to green`
> Describe in detail how to swap two nodes x and y (and not just their contents) in a singly linked list L given references only to x and y. Repeat this exercise for the case when L is a doubly linked list. Which algorithm takes more time?
```cpp
//using the structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```
To swap two nodes, you would have to create a temp Node that would contain the values of x. The node x would then contain the value and next pointer of y. While the y node, would have the value and next pointer of temp. 

For a doubly linked list, the same logic would apply except the prev pointer would also swap.

## Question 2 
>Draw the recursion trace for the execution of function ReverseArray(A,0,4) (Code Fragment 3.39 in Goodrich text) on array A={4,3,6,2,5}

```cpp
Algorithm ReverseArray(A, i, j):
    Input: An array A and nonnegative integer indices i and j
    Output: The reversal of the elements in A starting at index i and ending at j
    if i < j then: 
        Swap A[i] and A[ j]
        ReverseArray(A, i+1, jâˆ’1)
    return
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int ReverseArray(int* A, int i, int j){
    if(i < j) {
        int temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[j];
        A[j] = temp;
        ReverseArray(A, i+1, j-1);
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

int main(){
    int array[] = {4,3,6,2,5};
    ReverseArray(array, 0, 4);
    for(int i =0; i < sizeof(array)/sizeof(int); i++){
        std::cout << array[i] << std::endl;
    } 
}
```
Utilizing this code as a reference, the recursion trace for the recursion trace of the function `ReverseArray` for index `A(0,5)` would be:

## Question 3
>Write a tail recursive C++ function that finds both the minimum and maximum values in a c++ vector of int values without using any loops. Include a main method that tests your function by creating the vector A={1, -2, 0, 6, 66, -7} and printing the min and max values on a single line like this:
\> `Min -7 Max 66`

```cpp


```
