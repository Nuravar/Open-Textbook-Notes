# C++ Primer

#### Post-Increment vs Pre-Increment
Post-increments the counter after evaluating the expression
```cpp
int i = 7
int j = i++; //makes j = 7 and i = 8
```
Pre-increment the counter before evaluating the expression
```cpp
int i = 7   
int j = ++i; //makes j = 8 and i = 8
```
C++ is a high level programming language, which is a subset of the C programming language. It allows us to break up an application into classes to make programming easier. 

#### Enumerations 
An enumeration is a user defined type that can hold any set of discrete values. 

```cpp
enum Day = {SUN, MON,}
```
