# Greedy Algorithms

A **greedy** algorithm builds up a solution by choosing the option that looks the best at every step. 

> Say you are a cashier and you need to give someone 67 cents using as few counts as possible. How would you do it?

Whenever picking which coin to use, you would take the highest value coin you could at each step, until you cannot.That is a *greedy* algorithm because we are always greedily choosing the coin that covers the biggest portion of the remaining amount.
