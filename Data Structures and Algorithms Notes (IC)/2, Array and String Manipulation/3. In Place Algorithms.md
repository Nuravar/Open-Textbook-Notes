# In Place Algorithms

An in-place function modifies data structures or objects outside of its own stack frame (store on the process heap or in the stack frame of a calling function). Because of this, the changes made by the function remain after the call completes. 

An out-of-place function does not make any changes that are visible to other functions. Usually, those other functions copy any data structures or objects before manipulating and changing them \. 

In many language, primitive values are copied when passed as arguments and more complex data structures are passed by reference. In C++, arguments that are pointers or references can be modified in place. 

Here are two functions that do the same operation on a vector, except one is in-place and the other is out-of-place:

```cpp
  void squareVectorInPlace(vector<int>& intVector){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < intVector.size(); ++i) {
        intVector[i] *= intVector[i];
    }
    // NOTE: no need to return anything - we modified
    // intVector in place
}

vector<int> squareVectorOutOfPlace(const vector<int>& intVector){
    // we create a new vector with the size of the input vector
    vector<int> squaredVector(intVector.size());
    for (size_t i = 0; i < intVector.size(); ++i) {
        int item = intVector[i];
        squaredVector[i] =  item * item;
    }
    return squaredVector;
}

```

Working in-place is a good way to save time and space. An in-place algorithm avoids the cost of initializing or copying data structures and it usually has a O(1) space cost. 
+ Your input is "destroyed" which can affect code outside of your function
+ generally out-of-place algorithms are considered safer because they avoid side effects
