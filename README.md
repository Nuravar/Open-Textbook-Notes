# Open Source Textbook Notes
My own school-related/coding notes for a future project involving creating an open source textbook with these files as a base. My goal is to learn as I go and create everything listed below.

- [ ] Create a wide range of notes based on learning how to code (**In Progress**)
- [ ] Use Motion Canvas (https://motion-canvas.github.io/) to visualize each coding topic written about in markdown 
- [ ] Create a website that allows you to create/upload your own files alongside all of these notes
