# Open Source Textbook Notes
My own school-related notes for a future project involving creating an open source textbook with these files as a base. 

- [ ] Create a wide range of notes based on learning how to code (**In Progress**)
- [ ] Create a website that allows you to create/upload your own files alongside all of these notes
